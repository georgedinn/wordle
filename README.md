# Wordle

This is a Wordle clone I made pretty early on when I first started learning to code (I was around 6 months to a year in).

I've refactored it as a way to look back at how I used to write code, compare it to how I do things now, and spot areas where I've improved (or can still improve).

Each branch shows a different stage of the refactor.
